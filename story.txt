Once upon a time there was a frog. This frog loved to eat bugs and jump on lily pads of all kinds. One day the frog decided to try to eat all the bugs in my p2 implementation and choked to death. The End.
I thought it is the End and the frog is dead, but the surprise was the frog woke up again and completed eating my bugs in p3a implementation.
